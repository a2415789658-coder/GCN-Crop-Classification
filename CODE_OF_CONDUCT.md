# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of background or
identity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, inclusive,
and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Osman-Geomatics93/GCN-Crop-Classification/issues) page.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
